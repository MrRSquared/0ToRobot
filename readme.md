# XRP 0 to Autonomous

## What is zero to autonomous?
Zero to Autonomous is an incredible tutorial hosted by team 6814. 
The videos can be accessed on their [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJAoN-yI6AJDv7JJ3372yg).
They have all their code on [Git](https://github.com/SeanSun6814/FRC0ToAutonomous/tree/master) as well.

## Why a different repo for the XRP?
In using the Romi, we realized that there needs to be many small changes to the code in order to use it with the simbots. This made the otherwise incredible tutorials difficult for new programmers to follow.

## Which firmware does it use?
While one could follow the incredible tutorial here for the XRP without installing the WPILib software, these documents are made to go with the WPILib install. More details can be found [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/xrp-robot/index.html) and [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html).

## Changes for the XRP
The XRP uses a built-in Vendordep. The best way to do this is to either create a new project using the XRP template, or copy the Timed Skeleton folder and build from there.

From there, you can either use the premade drivetrain class, or use the directions in [WPILib's docs.](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/xrp-robot/hardware-support.html)
